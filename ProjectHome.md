The Java UML Profile allows easy and intuitive extension of UML2 elements. The standard way to extend UML2 models is done by the Profiling mechanism. This is a very powerful mechanism that allows all kind of extensions. The down side of this mechanism is its complexity. Using it requires deep understanding of UML2 and produces large amounts of code.
The main idea behind the Java UML Profile is to hide this complexity from the developer. Most of the development is done by interface declarations so the code that the developer required to produce is minimal. In addition to extending the UML2 models, the infrastructure hides the UML2 features which are not relevant for us. This way we can create a language that uses a subset of UML2 on one hand and extends it on the other.
